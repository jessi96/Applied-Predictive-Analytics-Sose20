    "Predictive models support decision-making by exploiting the underlying patterns in the data to extract insights for future use. In the real world, we often need to select one condition that gives us the \"best\" outcome. Examples could be treatment choice: for a certain disease, the doctors need to decide which medicine will be the most effective for the patients; or if we consider direct marketing campaigns where the customers receive emails for advertisements, the company would  like to send the customer the message that yields the highest revenue. Take the latter example, traditionally a classification model selects those customers who should be targeted. That is, the customers having the highest probabilities of  purchasing after receiving the email will be chosen.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    However, this is not what exactly desired -- there are customers who buy products even without receiving any emails, and targeting them will not increase our revenue, instead, we lose the cost of conducting the marketing campaign on them. Also, there exist the chance that the customers get annoyed by the campaign and don't want to buy any products anymore even though they would without getting the promotion emails. Hence, we want to know the causal relationship between the campaign and the purchasing behaviour of the customers. And this is where uplift modeling comes into play.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Uplift models were mainly used for conversion setting where the outcome variable is binary, for instance, the model tells us if a customer will buy a product or not, but there are not so many of them deal with continuous outcome, that is, instead of only predicting yes or no, the model gives prediction on how much money the customer is going to spend due to the campaign, or say, treatment. Except from the target variable, we also want to cope with multiple treatment cases instead of single treatment. Consider the email marketing example again, we now have different versions of email that are going to be sent to the potential target customers, in this case, we want to not only know if the email would increase the sales or not, but also which email would do so the best.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    On that account, the goal of this paper is to develop an uplift model that handles the case of both multiple treatments and continuous outcome. Our model has its foundation based on the Contextual Treatment Selection (CTS) developed by Zhao 2017 <font color=green>[13]</font>,  combined with AdaBoost algorithms. Boosting often dramatically improves performance of classification models, so we make use of this property and aim to improve the uplift model performance under multiple treatments and continuous outcome."

    "Uplift modeling is an approach used for estimating an effect of a treatment on the individual level. It models the incremental effect of a treatment on the target group and should help targeting only those people, who buy because they are subject to a treatment and wouldn’t buy otherwise. With the goal of improving user experience and engagement, it is often widely used in the fields of direct marketing and product offering (Zhao and Harinen 2019) <font color=green>[14]</font>. Other fields of application are for instance personalized medicine to find out for whom the medical treatment works best (Jaskowski and Jaroszewicz 2012 <font color=green>[7]</font>) or the banking or telecommunication sector (Radcliffe and Surry 2011 <font color=green>[10]</font>). Uplift models can be differentiated into two different kinds of models: conversion and revenue uplift models. In contrast to conversion models which aim at maximizing incremental sales, revenue uplift models strive at maximizing incremental revenue. This is especially reasonable when customers differ in their spending <font color=green>[3]</font>.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    A further distinction of uplift models can be made regarding the number of used treatments, for instance the number of different coupons values provided to the customers in a marketing campaign. While many uplift models covered in literature  discuss only single treatment, the focus is shifting more and more towards models considering multiple treatments. One reason herefore is the rather rare consideration of a single treatment in a real world business setting. Often companies want to compare different forms of promotions, for instance different channels or individual discount codes. Despite its relevance in practical applications, literature on multitreatment uplift is rather limited.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    The most basic form of measuring uplift is the Separate Model Approach (SMA), where two separate models are built independently from each other on the treatment and the control data.The SMA suggests to calculate the uplift by simply subtracting the estimated probability of the two separate models. Due to its simplicity and separate models for the treatment and control group it is possible to extend it to multiple treatments, whereby a separate model is build for each treatment (Zhao et al. 2017 <font color=green>[13]</font>). A clear advantage of the Two Model Approach is its simplicity and intuitive clarity, which is why it is often used to calculate benchmarks. There is also no need to develop new algorithms since it works with any state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm like XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin 2016 <font color=green>[1]</font>). However, the performance suffers from focusing on building two separate models. As a consequence, the models cannot pick up arelatively weak uplift signal compared to purchase proportion in control and treatment group(Radcliffe and Surry 2011 <font color=green>[10]</font>) and is often outperformed by other uplift approaches (Lo 2002 <font color=green>[8]</font>).\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Besides the Two Model Approach, another approach to model uplift is to model uplift directly through adapting existing machine learning algorithms like decision trees. A single model isused to predict uplift directly by considering both treatment and control groups. (As a result, it allows optimizing directly the uplift estimation.) In 2012, Rzepakowsi and Jaroszewicz (2012)<font color=green>[7]</font> introduced a decision tree uplift model with multiple treatments and customized splitting and pruning criteria. The primary objective in their model for splitting a unified uplift decision tree is to in increase the divergence of outcome distribution between the treatments and between the treatment and the control group. To evaluate each possible split, measures of divergence between class distributions like the squared Euclidian distance, chi-squared divergenceand Kullback-Leibler divergence are applied.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Guelman et al. (2012) <font color=green>[4]</font> extended this approach by using a Random Forest rather than asingle decision tree. The result of the Random Forest uplift model can be calculated by simply taking the average from each tree.\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "    In addition, Zhao et al. (2017) <font color=green>[13]</font> proposed a new direct uplift algorithm, which is a tree-based ensemble algorithm. The unique Splitting Criterion of the so called Contextual Treatment Se-lection (CTS) algorithm builds the decision trees in a way that it directly maximizes the expected response on the training set. At each step of the tree-growing process, the split that brings the greatest increase in expected response is chosen. What is special about CTS is that it can handle both multiple treatments and continuous outcomes. Uplift models are not only being continuously improved in terms of their applicability regarding multiple treatments, but also becoming more and more sophisticated and accurate in their prediction. One obvious approach for improving the performance of any classifier is the usage of Boosting, which can enhance the performance of a model remarkably. The basic idea of boosting is to incorporate many weak classifiers to obtain a better result in the end. A widespread application of Boosting is the AdaBoost algorithm, which combines three basic ideas: First, many weak classifiers arecombined to build a strong classifier. Second, some of the weak classifiers get to say more than the others in the final model and last but not least, each new simple classifier is built by taking the errors of the previous one into account (Freund and Schapire, 1994 <font color=green>[2]</font>). One successful attempt of adapting AdaBoost to uplift models is made by Soltys and Jaroszewicz (2018) <font color=green>[12]</font>. In their paper, they describe three properties that an uplift boosting algorithm should have. Based on that, they introduce three different uplift boosting algorithms, each satisfying two ofthe three properties. Nonetheless, the model proposed in this paper only deals with single treatment cases."

By decreasing the weights of the wrongly predicted observations, each weak learner focuses on the error of the previous one. Therefore, we will assign weights to each data points, and readjust the weights after each iteration. On top of that, the weak learners are also given corresponding weights to their prediction power for the later-on aggregation in order to obtain final predictions.\n",

    "From the pseudo code above, we can see that after assigning initial weights to the observations, we first fit a CTS model $h_m$ to the dataset $D^{t}$ and get the prediction for both treatment and expected response, then according to the prediction error defined before, we can obtain the model error rate --the proportion of wrongly predicted data points with regard to data weights $w_i$ from the formula <font color=blue>$1$</font> given in step  <font color=blue>$2b$</font>.\n",

Since the model weight  $\\beta_m$ is between $0$ and $1$, the observation weights get smaller when multiplied with it; and larger when multiplied with the reciprocal, here we have the observation weights multiplied with not only the reciprocal of the model weights $\\beta_m$, but the reciprocal of  $(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta_m)$ for a reason, and this is explained shortly. In addition to decrease the weight for correct predictions and increase the weight for wrong predictions, we strive to also retain one property from the original AdaBoost --when a stronger model, which means it has lower error rate, makes a wrong prediction, we increase the weight of that data point even more; correspondingly, when a weak model gives a correct prediction, we also decrease the weight even more. And this is the reason why we designed the update of the observation weight for wrong predictions in the way that it's multiplied with the reciprocal of  $(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta_m)$ instead of the reciprocal of $\\beta_m$.\n",

Furthermore, since it's equal to $\\beta_m$, it has the innate characteristics that when $\\beta_m$ declines, it falls as well. This is consistent to our wish that the weights drops even more when even a weak model gives correct predictions."

The uplift curves of all the models are not steadily increasing, meaning that targeting as many consumers as possible won’t lead to the best result. This is in line with marketing theory since at a certain point at targeting more and more people, also people who would have responded anyway or for whom the action actually has no impact will be targeted, leading to unnecessary contact costs. Another observation is that all curves are decreasing directly in the beginning. One possible explanation for this is that the models are performing quiet bad and are not able to target the right persons in the beginning as first customers.

An indicator for the bad performance can already be found when looking at the predictions of the money spend by each customer. The predicted amount of money spend is increasing in each round steadily, which should not be the case. A possible cause for the bad performance of the Uplift AdaBoost algorithm is possibly the step of random oversampling. Since many of the cases in the data set have a real spending of 0 euro, all these persons get classified as correct by the algorithm in the beginning. As a consequence, these cases have a low assigned weight and will possibly dropping out of the data frame after weighted sampling. These cases with 0 euro spend initially decreased the overall average, which is why after their dropping out the predicted amount of money spend increases.

    "In this seminar paper, our goal was to develop an uplift algorithm for multiple treatments and continuous outcome, that incorporates some kind of boosting to further improve the performance of uplift models. Therefore, we developed an algorithm based on the CTS algorithm from Zhao et al. (2017) <font color=green>[13]</font> and the AdaBoost algorithm. The algorithm aims at predicting the best treatment for each observation and giving the predicted response under this treatment.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Unfortunately, the evaluation based on a data set from an online shoe retailer provided unexpectedly bad results. We still are convinced by the basic idea of the boosting uplift algorithm for multiple treatments, but some adjustments need to be made. Overall, all of the three used algorithms performed rather poor, leading to the suggestions that there is still much room for improvement."

    "Since we believe that the rather poor performance of the Uplift AdaBoost algorithm is caused by the random sampling procedure, it would be interesting to see, if the sampling procedure can be included in another way into the algorithm. One possible idea is to integrate random sampling directly into the CTS algorithm of Zhao et al. (2017) <font color=green>[13]</font>, in the way that when the average response in each child node is calculated, instead of taking the simple average, adopting weighed mean would help to avoid the left-out samples resulting from random sampling with the observation weight.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "For future research it is also interesting to consider the cost factor of the treatment in the Uplift AdaBoost algorithm. When sending discount coupons to customers, the costs for the company should also always be kept in mind. A high discount significantly reduces the company's profit and is therefore should also be considered in the customer targeting decision."
